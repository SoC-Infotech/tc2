### Functional Requirements (Hangman)

### Main processes of App

This wireframe design has a total of 8 pages, each with its own unique purpose that makes up the game. 
1.	Main Menu Screen. User can mute sound, play game, get Help on playing the game, or Quit the program. 
2.	Help Page. Explains the rules of the game, has a back button which will bring the user back to Main Menu Page.
3.	Loading Screen. Only pops up when Play is pressed, Game is Reset or moving to next round. 
4.	Info Game Screen. Shows the user the theme of the phrase, the blank letters as well as the amount of lives they have (which is set to 5 after every win/loss).
5.	Neutral Game Screen. Screen which shows the users remaining lives, the aforementioned Theme & Phrase, as well as the letter one can input (can be changed using Vol Up/Down or swiping Up/Down)
6.	Wrong Letter screen. If a letter is wrong, the player loses a life and the letter is placed over a Red NO symbol. Letter is then removed from list of available letters to guess off of.
7.	Correct Letter Screen. Correct letters will be placed in the missing area, square surrounding the letter turns green with the text “Correct” over it. Correct letters are also removed from the list of available letters.
8.	Game Over Screen. When the player runs out of lives, “Game Over” comes up and shows the player score which is based off of their lives carried over from a previous round. The option to return HOME or Retry (not on wireframe) come up on the screen. 
9.	Win Screen. When the correct phrase is guessed then the player wins. Screen shows the Phrase, “You win” in large text as well as Score, Return home or Next round buttons.

### Evaluation of Hangman Game

#### Main Menu Screens

##### The Home page is pretty straightforward with presenting the options for the user to interact with as seen in figure 2.1. Although the design is rather basic, it suits the capabilities of the device it is running as we did not want to have a program that is very demanding and can cause issues such as delays, freezing or crashing (Minimalist Design).
